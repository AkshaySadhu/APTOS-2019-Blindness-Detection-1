## APTOS-2019-Blindness-Detection([Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection))

This was a competition hosted on Kaggle in July-August 2019. Here, In this competition the aim was to build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection. The images were collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically. 

In this competition, we had 3662 images in 5 classes for training and the data was highly imbalanced. We started with very simple models like from resnet50 and in starting we didn't used much of preprocessing. And we got a public score of around 68%
and private score around 87%. And after with a lot of preprocessing which includes ben's cropping, circular crop, change in brightness, contrast, converting to grayscale we got private score of around 89% .

And our final rank was 471 out of 2943. We learnt a lot during this competition like how to deal with medical images, what kind of preprocessing techniques to use and how to use differnt CNN architectures and when to use them.team
